Regression Project

The purpose of this project is to help private investors or studios determine what movies to invest in for 2022. With vaccines rolling out and the CDC making updates to COVID prodocals, soon people will be able to return to their normal activities. To take advantage of people's eagerness to go out and do activities, investors are interested in funding film productions. Using requests and Beautiful Soup, I will web scrape Box Office Mojo to pull the data needed for analysis. Then using Scikit-learn, I will create linear regression models to identify any correlations between features and the success of a movie. I expect to work with the following features: genre, lead actors/actress, director, producer, franchise, opening number of theaters, box office gross, release date, budget, DVD sales and distributor. I would like to also include critic ratings from Rotten Tomatoes as an additional feature. With the results of my analysis, I will be able to give investors/studios recommendations on what types of film to invest in.
