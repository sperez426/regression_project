Regression Project

The purpose of this project is to help private investors or producers determine what movies to invest in for 2022. With vaccines rolling out and the CDC making updates to COVID prodocals, soon people will be able to return to their normal activities. To take advantage of people's eagerness to go out and do activities, investors are interested in funding film productions. To get started on my analysis, I will use 'get' requests to retrieve the pages of the top domestic movies from Box Office Mojo. Next I will use Beautiful Soup to parse the data in order to distinguish the movies and their features as well as add it into a list of dictionaries. The list of dictionaries will be converted into a dataframe which I plan to store in an SQL database. Finally using Scikit-learn, I will create linear regression models to identify any correlations between the features and the success of a movie (lifetime gross). I expect to work with the following features: genre, lead actors/actress, director, producer, franchise, opening number of theaters, box office gross, release date, budget, DVD sales and distributor. With the results of my analysis, I will be able to predict what types of movies will likely achieve higher lifetime gross.
