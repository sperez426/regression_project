# Movie Regression
![](movie_features_heatmap.png)

I created a heatmap to see if there were any noticable relationships between features and check for multicollinearity. The figure shows an strong relationship between action movies and budget. I also created an OLS model to further look into the relationships of the features and the target variable (lifetime gross) by examining the P-values and R-squared value. Finally, I preformed a train/test split to determine what type of regression model to use. Based on the scores, the polynomial regression is the best model to use.
